## About me

I have a Master's degree in Mathematics (Part III) from the [University of Cambridge](http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/) and I also graduated from [Ecole CentraleSupélec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CentraleSup%C3%A9lec) [(Centrale Paris pathway)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Centrale_Paris) within [Paris-Saclay University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris-Saclay_University) [(see Shanghai Ranking in Mathematics)](https://www.shanghairanking.com/rankings/gras/2021/RS0101). Before that, I completed two years of preparatory program (CPGE) at [Lycée Louis-le-Grand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyc%C3%A9e_Louis-le-Grand).  


## Current Projects

My last role was working as an intern at ENS Ulm/Inria working on *Multi-task learning and Huntington's disease*.
