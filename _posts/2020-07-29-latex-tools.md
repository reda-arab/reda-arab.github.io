Mathpix Snipping Tool 
======
[Mathpix Snipping Tool](https://mathpix.com/) is a software that allows to take screenshots of Mathematics' formulas from PDFs or handwritten notes and obtain the corresponding LaTex formulas. 

I personnally use it to create my personal handouts from lecture notes (e.g. when you want to create a document without proof or comment) and to avoid wasting time looking for the exact LaTex formulas. 

From my personal experience, it does not really work well with handwritten notes and you have to rewrite a large part of the content (I guess it largely depends on handwriting). But, if you have a lot of handwritten notes you want to type, I think it will definitely make your life easier.  

Vim
======
I found this article ["How I'm able to take notes in mathematics lectures using LaTeX and Vim"](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/) which explains a very interesting setup allowing to write in LaTex very fast using Vim.
