The aim of this blog post is to gather different resources on Machine Learning. 

I will update this post or create a serie of posts in the future to add/update the resources.

N.B. : The way I choose resources is based only on what I found useful and relevant.

Machine Learning resources
======
You can find [here](https://sgfin.github.io/learning-resources/?fbclid=IwAR1mdvyzKHj4Z1jvBKsZTzpZiDwDO8wRmAruv69p_1I223WizSuwqhVy9fE#causal) a blog post of Sam Finlayson who gathered a lot of resources and published them online. A similar type of [blog post](https://medium.com/machine-learning-in-practice/my-curated-list-of-ai-and-machine-learning-resources-from-around-the-web-9a97823b8524) on Medium from Robbie Allen.


I want to add some other interesting resources : 
- All courses on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) given by deeplearning.ai and Andrew Ng concerning Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
- The [lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0&list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ) given at UCL by David Silver (DeepMind) on Reinforcement Learning available on Youtube.
- [Learning resources](https://deepmind.com/learning-resources) provided by DeepMind.
- Resources on [Qingyuan Zhao's website](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~qz280/teaching/causal-2020/) on Causal Inference.
- [Kaggle courses and competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/) in order to put into practice theories (ML, DL, NLP,...)
- For French readers : un [lexique utile](http://variances.eu/?p=5212&fbclid=IwAR3iBy6FM3TDI4m_0BJyyp3iDZ8xrqXXtQ3otVSz44RdDBMqXI-vMl3seAI ) pour le jargon du ML 
- ML and Speech Recognition [Glossary](https://www.speechly.com/blog/nlu-voice-speech-recognition-terms-glossary/)
- [Deep learning courses](http://introtodeeplearning.com/) by MIT 
- An [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/ten-machine-learning-concepts-you-should-know-for-data-science-interviews-70107ca84754) on 10 concepts to know for Data Science Interviews
- An [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/best-resources-for-deep-learning-f4c774356734) by Pierre Sadrach which gathers deep learning resources
- Different [cheatsheets](https://github.com/shervinea?tab=repositories) by Shervine Amidi
- A non-exhaustive [list](https://medium.springboard.com/30-twitter-influencers-you-have-to-follow-for-ai-machine-learning-977587b6406e) of some Twitter influencers on AI. 
- [Machine Learning Interviews Book](https://huyenchip.com/ml-interviews-book/) by Chip Huyen. Her [blog](https://huyenchip.com/blog/) contains interesting articles also. 
- [Datasets](https://paperswithcode.com/datasets) from paperswithcode.  
- Open-Source Machine Learning libraries : [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [Keras.io](https://keras.io/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [CNTK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/) (Microsoft), Berkeley AI Research library [Caffe](https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/).
