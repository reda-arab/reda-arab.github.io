Summary PCA 
======
I made a [document](https://reda-arab.github.io/files/PCA_explanation_english.pdf) which aims to give an intuitive mathematical explanation of PCA (Principal Component Analysis).

An [French version](https://reda-arab.github.io/files/PCA_Explication_intuitive_francais.pdf) is also available.

Interesting ressources on PCA : 
======
- A [very interesting discussion on PCA](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/2691/making-sense-of-principal-component-analysis-eigenvectors-eigenvalues). The 'top' answer introduces the concept by giving an example of characteristics of wine bottles.

- A [discussion about the link between SVD and PCA](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/134282/relationship-between-svd-and-pca-how-to-use-svd-to-perform-pca), clearly explained. 

- A [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgakZw6K1QQ) on Youtube by StatQuest.

- A [post on PCA for Data Science](https://pca4ds.github.io/) by Tomas Aluja-Banetn, Alain Morineau and Gaston Sanchez.

- Well-explained lectures by Ryan Tibshirani : [part I](https://reda-arab.github.io/files/07-dim1.pdf), [part II](https://reda-arab.github.io/files/08-dim2.pdf) and [part III](https://reda-arab.github.io/files/09-dim3.pdf). The entire course on Data Mining can be found [here](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/datamining/lectures/).

- [Lecture notes of the chapter 9 PCA](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-650-statistics-for-applications-fall-2016/lecture-slides/MIT18_650F16_PCA.pdf) of the course Statistics for applications delivered by MIT. They are clear, simple and go straight to the point.
