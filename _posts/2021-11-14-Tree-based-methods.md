Cheatsheet 
======
I made a [document](https://reda-arab.github.io/files/Tree_based_Methods.pdf) which aims to summarize the important notions of tree-based methods :
decision trees, pruning, bagging, random forest, boosting. 

I will focus on specific libraries and new methods in another articles (e.g. XGBoost, CatBoost, LGBM)

Interesting ressources on tree-based methods  :
