======
This [document](https://reda-arab.github.io/files/Correlated features - Linear Regression.pdf) aims to give a geometrical approach of what is happens when two features
are correlated when applying linear regression/OLS.


Another [way](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-exclude-highly-correlated-f
